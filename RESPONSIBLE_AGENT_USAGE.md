# Responsible Agent Usage

This document declares and explains how large language models (hereinafter referred to as LLMs) and intelligent agents were responsibly used in the development of this project. It aims to ensure transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness in our software development practices.

## 1. Scope of Use

The core algorithms, architecture design, performance optimization, and security-related components of this project were fully authored and reviewed by human developers.
Only certain non-core code segments (such as helper functions, data structure wrappers, test cases, or boilerplate code) were generated with the assistance of an LLM under the explicit instruction, supervision, and review of the project lead or designated developers.

## 2. Method of Use

The process of using LLMs in this project was as follows:

Developers provided natural language descriptions detailing the intended logic, constraints, and implementation requirements;

The LLM produced an initial implementation based on those descriptions;

The output was manually reviewed, modified, and validated by human developers before inclusion in the codebase.

Accordingly, the LLM functioned as a translator of human intent into code or an auxiliary authoring tool, rather than as an autonomous decision-making or creative agent.

## 3. Responsibility and Review

The project lead and primary developers retain full responsibility for the project’s overall design, correctness, and code quality.
All LLM-generated code has been manually inspected to ensure compliance with project standards for maintainability, reliability, and security.

## 4. Model and Version

The project may have employed LLM services such as the OpenAI GPT series or other comparable models.
The specific model version or provider does not affect the applicability of this declaration.

## 5. Responsible AI and Agentic Development

The project team actively supports the responsible use of large language models and agent-based systems.
We are committed to implementing best practices in model-assisted software development, emphasizing human oversight, data integrity, and ethical deployment.
Through these practices, we aim to deliver trustworthy, reliable, and high-quality software artifacts to our users and the broader open-source community.

## 6. Limitations and Disclaimer

LLM-generated content was used only under human direction, supervision, and verification;

Code generated by LLMs does not constitute independent original authorship;

This declaration aims to promote transparency and does not imply endorsement, warranty, or authorization from any LLM provider.
