[Version 0.3.0]

This version introduces a new framework which is not compatible to the previous version.
It relies more on interfaces rather than abstract classes to describe symbols.
Meanwhile, previous extension methods to 'ILGenerator' have been removed,
for they can be replaced by extension methods to 'ISymbol<T>' with more convenient usage.

Compared to 0.2.x versions, this new framework has full support for non-generic symbols;
now all non-generic symbols can be converted to generic symbols, 
and most extension methods can be invoked on them.

We also implement unit tests for all core features of this framework to ensure its correctness;
and we have been doing dog-fooding to improve the design of this framework on several projects,
including but not limited to InjectionExpert and SnapshotExpert.

NOTE:

The Roslyn Compiler of .NET 10 has some issues causing it to generate false-positive warnings
about the nullability constraints of generic extension methods, such as CS8620.
This issue has been reported to Microsoft and we are following up with updates.
